A complete decentralized lottery application that is built with Solidity and a modern React (Next.js) frontend. Users enter the lottery by sending ETH, and the owner of the lottery can draw a winner from the total prize pool.


###  Smart Contract (`CryptoLottery.sol`)
Here are the features of the lottery:
- Start new lottery (`startLottery`) using a custom entry fee (only callable by owner)
- Allow users to enter with exact ETH (`enter`)
- Do not allow multiple entries using `hasEntered`
- Pick a winner randomly using `block.prevrandao` (only callable by owner)
- Transfer full balance to winner and reset lottery
- Emit events for all actions (`LotteryStarted`, `PlayerEntered`, `WinnerSelected`, `LotteryReset`)
- Check players with `getPlayers()` and contract balance with `getBalance()`
